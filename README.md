Wasted Spark Ignition System for Atomic4 Engine. 

Should work as the basis for most 4 cylinder engines.
Calculates ignition timing and sends RPM to the onbaord boat computer in NMEA format.
remote debug can be used to access debug information while the engine runs.

Hardware:
The coil pack is a 032 905 106b VW imitation.
Two magnets 180 degrees opposite and polar opposites are mounted to the fly wheel (crank). 
One of the magents is placed at TDC.

December 2020 Engine running very well. 
Engine running on ESP32

ign-esp32-tdc-wifi.ino : Dual core setup with Wifi page presenting data as per video. (obsolete)
ign-esp8266-tdc.ino : Stopped developing this but it was running well, the basis should work for an single core arduino (obsolete)
